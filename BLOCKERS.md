## How to Handle Blockers

1. **Document the blocker** - Add to Active Blockers with:
   - Which task is blocked
   - What the issue is
   - What was tried

2. **Mark task as blocked** - In STATUS.md, change `[ ]` to `[!]`

3. **Move to next task** - Skip blocked tasks, continue with unblocked ones

4. **Resolve and update** - When fixed:
   - Move from Active to Resolved
   - Update STATUS.md back to `[ ]` or `[x]`
   - Note the resolution for future reference

## Known Limitations

- **PostgreSQL required** - Local dev needs PostgreSQL running
- **Telegram bot token** - Need to register with @BotFather before Phase 6
- **Environment variables** - Will need .env.local for secrets
